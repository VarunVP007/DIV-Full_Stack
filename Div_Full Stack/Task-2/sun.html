        "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core."

        The Sun is the most important source of energy for life on Earth. It is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium and has a diameter about 109 times that of Earth. The Sun's gravity holds the Solar System together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris in its orbit.
